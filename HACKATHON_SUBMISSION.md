## 🎯 Project Description

An endless runner game inspired by Jetpack Joyride where players pay an entry fee in cryptocurrency and earn rewards based on their final score. Built with XO Connect integration for seamless wallet connectivity in Beexo Wallet.

**How it works:**
1. Connect wallet (Beexo Wallet or MetaMask)
2. Pay 0.001 MATIC entry fee
3. Play the endless runner game
4. Earn crypto rewards based on score tier
5. Claim rewards on-chain

## 🏆 Reward Tiers

| Score | Tier | Multiplier | Payout |
|-------|------|------------|--------|
| 500+ | 🥉 Bronze | 1x | 0.001 MATIC |
| 1000+ | 🥈 Silver | 2x | 0.002 MATIC |
| 2000+ | 🥇 Gold | 5x | 0.005 MATIC |
| 5000+ | 💎 Diamond | 10x | 0.01 MATIC |

**House Edge:** Entry fees from losing games (score < 500) fund the reward pool
